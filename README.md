# crazyflie_simulation

Hi! Welkom to the crazyflie simulation repo. This repo is still at the early stages and still in development so just ask if you are looking for anything in particular.

Currently it contains low resolution meshes based on the design of the actual [crazyflie 2.1](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) but heavily simplified to contain as little vertices as possible, so it can be used to simulate a lot of them.

## IMPORTANT
modify this line with your local path
simulator_files/webots/controllers/crazyflie_controller_py_wallfollowing/crazyflie_controller_py_wallfollowing.py

```
sys.path.append('/home/lamberti/work/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python/examples/multiranger/wall_following')
```
